# Cancelled 

With sadness, we've decided to cancel the party on September 11 in San Anselmo. After much consideration, we decided that with the surge in COVID in California and elsewhere, we could not gather everyone we'd like to safely and comfortably. 

My sincere apologies for the change of plans. I miss each of you greatly, and can't wait to see you in person sometime soon.

Please stay safe and healthy.

Josh
